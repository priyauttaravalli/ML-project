                    We are a team of four enthusiastic students from GMR Institute of Technology, Rajam, united by a shared vision to create a sustainable future. Our passion for innovation and technology drives us to tackle pressing environmental challenges, starting with waste management in cities.

                    With the increasing urbanization and waste generation, we recognize the urgent need for efficient and effective solutions to classify and manage waste. To address this, we have developed an advanced web application that integrates Machine Learning (ML) to automatically classify waste into 12 distinct categories. This precise classification facilitates proper recycling and disposal, directly contributing to environmental sustainability.
                    
                    Our web application is designed to make waste management smarter and more accessible, empowering individuals, communities, and organizations to take proactive steps toward a cleaner, greener world.<br>
                    <br><b><h4>Our Mission</h4></b><br>
                    Promote environmental sustainability by leveraging technology to enhance waste management practices.
                    Educate and empower users with an easy-to-use platform that encourages responsible waste disposal.
                    Innovate continuously to expand the scope and impact of our solutions.<br>
                    <br><b><h4>Our Expertise</h4></b><br>
